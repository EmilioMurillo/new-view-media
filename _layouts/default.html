      content="I am a passionate entrepreneur
      who recognizes the potential of media to
      educate, entertain and engage.  As new
      technologies continue to develop and
      allow individuals to connect and
      communicate efficiently like no other
      period in our history, the importance
      of video has risen astronomically.
      Thus, I strive to gather passionate
      teams together to collaborate and produce
      video projects that promote innovative
      ideas and push humanity forward."

      content="In today’s fast paced world, every frame matters as viewers have an overload of content competing for their attention. With new technologies, the barriers to create video content has decreased. However, the importance of telling stories that advance humanity has never been greater. Through the medium of video, we intend to educate, entertain and motivate action."

Unfortunately, the current media landscape inconsistently stimulates an intellectual forum that leads to action towards socially responsible causes. Therefore, NewView.Media will produce video content that engages our audience to think about new views."
